The specific research topic and area of interest can be discussed together; however, at the moment we have a bioinformatic-based self-funded PhD studentship project advertised focussed on investigating antimicrobial resistance mechanisms and transmission ability via their genetic associations. In this project, the student will use pangenomic and phylogenetic analyses to investigate the genetic associations between known antimicrobial resistance genes and other genetic elements (genes, mutations etc.) within the bacterial genome. For more information and to apply, please visit <a href="whelanlab.co.uk">the findaphd.com advert</a> (to be posted soon). There is no fixed application deadline for this studentship. </p>

This is a lab-based project - with some bioinformatic work - that aims to understand the ecological and evolutionary changes in the lung microbiome that occur during pulmonary exacerbation. In this project, the student will culture sputum samples in collaboration with our clinical colleagues, and isolate a large number of strains in order to produce a CF strain biobank. Then, the student will use our robots/other equipment to conduct high-throughput phenomic assays (e.g., for antimicrobial resistance, secondary metabolite production, swimming, swarming etc.) to quantify evolutionary changes over the course of exacerbation. Finally, we will use genomics to identify the accessory gene content of each organism's pangenome.
