I am delighted to announce that I have been awarded a 2023 Lister Institute Research Prize Fellowship! The Lister Research Prizes are awarded to 6 early career biomedical scientists each year based on criteria including originality/quality of the research, past achievements, and the impact that the receipt of this Prize would have on their career. The Fellowship runs for 5-years and each year, all current Fellows have the chance to meet for a short conference to discuss their research with their peers.

Receipt of this Fellowship means a lot to me and to the Whelan lab. It is such a privilege to be acknowledged by such a prestigious organization and an absolute honour to join a group of expert biomedical scientists beginning their independent research careers.
