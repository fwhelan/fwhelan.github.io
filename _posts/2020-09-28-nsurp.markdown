The presentations that Gabriela and Robert put together as part of their 4 week NSURP Undergraduate Summer Projects in the Whelan lab have gone live on the [NSURP website][nsurp]. Both students did an excellent job learning the ins and outs of the cystic fibrosis and microbiome literature in such a short amount of time, and applied what they learnt to the interpretation of 16S rRNA gene sequencing data using softwares such as R and phyloseq. They put a lot of work into these short projects and that really shows in their final presentations!

Robert and Gabriela were part of a large cohort of great Undergraduate Summer projects focussed in microbiology and there are some amazing presentations posted in a variety of areas, so go check them out [here][nsurp]!
