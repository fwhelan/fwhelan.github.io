Fiona's research has been recognized by the Academy of Medical Sciences in it's flagship Springboard award scheme. The AMS Springboard award aims to give early career scientists in the area of biomedical and health research the ability to establish their independent research careers. The Whelan lab will use this award in collaboration with [Prof Alvaro Mata][mata] to investigate how pathogens and microbes interact in a hydrogel model of cystic fibrosis biofilms. Read more about the recent announcement, including a quote from Fiona, [here][ams].
