Iremide Sanyaolu, a Microbiology undergraduate student at Trintiy College Dublin, spent the last summer with us as a fully-funded Wellcome Trust Biomedical Vacation Scholarship student. Iremide spent 8-weeks in the Whelan lab advancing our understanding of interactions between Staphylococcus aureus and other members of the cystic fibrosis lung microbiome.

As part of the Scholarship, Iremide interacted with other Scholars as part of the Wellcome Trust programme, and had a chance to chat with Rachael Prescott, Project Officer to the Researcher Academy Leadership Team, and Andy Baritt, Researcher Engagement Officer with Research Innovation, about her experience. Check out the 2-minute interview [here][here].

It was a pleasure to have Iremide in the lab! This is the second time that the Whelan lab has hosted a Wellcome Trust Biomedical Vacation Scholar and we hope to do so again soon.
