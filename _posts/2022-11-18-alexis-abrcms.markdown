A hug congratulations to Alexis for being awarded the poster award for best poster in the microbiology category for her recent poster presentation at [ABRCMS 2022][abrcms]. Alexis's poster was based on the research that she conducted in the Whelan lab during her [NSURP][nsurp] summer placement on the cystic fibrosis lung microbiome. 

Congratulations, Alexis!
