The Whelan lab is pleased to announce that we will be moving to the University of Manchester in April 2024. Fiona will join the Microbial Evolution Research Manchester [(MERMan)][merman] group as a Senior Lecturer in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics. We're really excited to join the vibrant and academically stimulating [Division of Evolution, Infection, and Genomics][division] which sits within the [School of Biological Sciences][school] and [Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health][fbmh]. This will be a return to Manchester for Fiona who conducted a short 1 year PDRA in the [McInerney lab][mcinerney] at U of Manchester before transferring to the University of Nottingham to undertake her Marie Sklodowska-Curie Independent Fellowship.
