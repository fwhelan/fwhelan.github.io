The lab has received a [Royal Society Research Grant][grant] on "defining the effect of the microbiota on antimicrobial resistance." This grant will help the lab get a chronic infection Drosophilia melanogaster infection model established. This model has been used previously by other groups to study microbe-microbe and microbe-host interactions in high-throughput; our work will build upon this to understand how antimicrobial resistance of an organism can be affected by its microbial neighbours in mixed microbial communities.
