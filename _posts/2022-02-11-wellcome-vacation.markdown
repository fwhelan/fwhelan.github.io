The Whelan lab is currently recruiting eligible Undergraduate students to apply for a 6-8 week summer placement via the Wellcome Biomedical Vacation Scholarship in partnership with the University of Nottingham. The placement will involve using *in vitro* microbiological techniques to investigate the interactions between strains of the *Streptococcus anginosus* group (SAG) and *Prevotella sp.* in the cystic fibrosis microbiome. Full details of the project are outlined below.
