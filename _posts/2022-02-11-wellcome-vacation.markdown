The Whelan lab is currently recruiting eligible Undergraduate students to apply for an 8 week summer placement via the Wellcome Biomedical Vacation Scholarship in partnership with the University of Nottingham. The placement will involve using *in vitro* microbiological techniques to investigate the interactions between strains of the *Streptococcus anginosus* group (SAG) and *Prevotella sp.* in the cystic fibrosis microbiome. Full details of the project are outlined below.

For more information and to apply, please visit UoN's Biomedical Vacation Scholarships [webpage][url] (Project 4).

Title: Understanding the interactions between members of the *Streptococcus anginosus* group and *Prevotella sp.* in the cystic fibrosis lung microbiome.

Background: Cystic fibrosis (CF) affects approximately 12,000 people in the UK and Ireland. Pulmonary exacerbations (PEs) cause most of the morbidity and mortality in this patient population. Because PEs are usually successfully treated with antibiotics, we know that the bacteria that inhabit the lungs play an important role in these events. Previous work from myself and others has determined that the presence of the bacteria in the CF lung do not change before, during, and after PEs, suggesting that interactions between members of the microbiota may be more important in driving PEs than their presence alone.

Previous research suggests important interactions between the Streptococcus anginosus group (SAG) and Prevotella sp. (Prev) in the CF lung. For example, our group has found an SAG which prevents the growth of an Prevotella melanogenica. In this project, we hypothesize that SAG and Prev will interact in a strain-dependent manner. To test this, we will use in vitro competition spot assays to assess the interactions between a variety of SAG and Prev strains isolated from the CF lung microbiota using 2 selective agars – KVLB and McKay.

Specific aims:

1. Use 2 selective agars to culture SAG and Prev present in the microbial community of a fresh sputum sample collected by our collaborators.

The student will begin by culturing a sputum sample obtained from an individual with CF on two selective agars. The first agar, KVLB – Kanamycin, Vancomycin Laked Blood agar – selects for gram-negative anaerobic bacilli. When used to culture samples from the CF lung microbiota, approximately 80% of isolates grown are Prevotella sp. The second agar, McKay agar, was specifically designed to select for SAG organisms from the CF lung microbiome. After 3-5 days, the student and I will work together to isolate, record, count, and image each unique phenotype which has grown on these 2 selective agars (weeks 1-2).

2. Use an in vitro competition spot assay to test the interactions between SAG and Prev cultured in Aim 1.

Following isolate collection, the student will use a high-throughput competition spot assay to identify the interactions between SAG-Prev pairs. The competition assay involves setting up a 48-well plate of various SAG isolates and stamping them onto multiple plates of a general media in high-throughput; after 24 hours, each plate will be stamped with 48 colonies of a single Prev strain, pinned directly next to the SAG isolates. The resulting SAG-Prev strain pairs will be categorized as interacting synergistically if one or both colonies have a growth circumference larger than single-strain controls, antagonistically if one or both colonies fail to grow or have a decreased growth circumference, or neutral if there is no effect on growth (compared to controls). (weeks 3-5). The student and I will collect and summarize the experimental data. Images of each plate will be taken, and spot circumference measured using ImageJ software. We will use R to generate a heatmap of the spot circumference of each SAG-Prev pair. We will categorize isolates as interacting synergistically/antagonistically and decide on the 10 SAG-Prev pairs which best merit further investigation (week 6).

3. Follow up on a subset of interaction pairs using further microbial assays.

A subset of SAG-Prev pairs will be tested with in vitro assays including: (a) determining the importance of physical proximity by spotting on solid agar at various distances; (b) assessing the importance of secreted proteins and/or alterations to the environment via growth of each member of the isolate pair in the sterile spent culture medium of the other; (c) assessing the importance of the metabolic environment by competing on a variety of agar types. These follow up experiments will show whether the observations from the competition assay are generalizable across media types and conditions, and provide the first step in our understanding of the mechanism of interaction (weeks 7-8).
