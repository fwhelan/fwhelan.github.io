An overdue congratulations to Francis Gyapong for the recent acknowledgements of his excellent research presentations. Francis began the 2024/5 conference season well with being awarded 1st place in his year in the 3 Minute Thesis (3MT) competition at the [Envision DTP][envision] Annual Conference, April 2025. Here, Francis presented the last 2-years of his PhD research in just 3 minutes with the presentaiton entitled "Sticklebacks from neutral pH lakes host more diverse bacteria in their skin microbiome".

Only a few weeks later, Francis won Best Poster Presentation at the University of Nottingham School of Life Sciences PGR Conference, June 2025. Francis's poster, "Environmental Variation Shapes the Stickleback Skin Microbiome", garnered a lot of attention from his peers and poster judges (image below).

Congratulations, Francis!
