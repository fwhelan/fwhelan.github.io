<h3><b>Robert Alston, NSURP Undergraduate (2020)</b></h3>

Robert joined the lab as a senior at <a href="https://www.nccu.edu/">North Carolina Central University</a> studying Pharmaceutical Sciences.  Robert's interests include looking at how the immune systems function can be improved upon naturally, with the use of plants and/or plant derived pharmaceuticals.  With the current COVID 19 pandemic, his on-campus summer internship was canceled.  As <a href="https://nsurp.org/">a NSURP mentee</a>, Robert was investigating whether there are quantitative differences in the microbiota found in the lower respiratory tract of cystic fibrosis patients when they are in an exacerbated vs. stable state.  He is also investigating whether these differences are universal or patient specific.
